# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

globals are like test .. describe can be for a unit of code, like a function, and it would be the specific test cases for that unit of code


2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

To minimize bugs in code, gives you a better idea of what your code should be doing, makes edge cases more apparent. I think you can do a best of both worlds, build your test and build the code at the same time, both building upon each other


3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use case for them?
